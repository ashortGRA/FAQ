<h2 id="category1">1. Overview and Purpose of GRA</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="question1">What is the main goal of Georgia Research Alliance (GRA)?</dt><dd>GRA's main aims are to (1) recruit top faculty to Georgia's universities and (2) move university technologies from university labs into the marketplace. These goals support the development of small businesses in Georgia, creating a robust industrial base and high-quality jobs. </dd><dt id="question2">What are GRA’s funding programs?</dt><dd>GRA has two funding arms: early funding through the GRA Venture Development program (GRAV), and later funding through the GRA Venture Fund (GRAVF). Once a commercializable innovation has been made in academia, there are many steps that need to occur before company formation and the institutional fundraising needed to scale that company towards profitability. GRA Venture Development or GRAV aims to fill the funding gap for those activities through grant funding for early proof-of-concept work and loan funding for later commercialization activities. Following GRAV funding and the incorporation of a company, GRA Venture Fund makes seed and series A venture capital investments in the most promising companies that have been vetted and expanded through the GRAV program. </dd><dt id="question3">How much funding is available through GRA programs?</dt><dd>Phase I: 50K grant in two milestone-based tranches (i.e. 25K for the first proposal, 25k for the second contingent on milestones)<br>Phase II: 100K grant in two milestone-based tranches, requires matching funding from e.g. a commercialization grant like an SBIR or other commercialization financing<br>Phase III: 250K loan in two milestone-based tranches<br>Venture fund: ~250-500K seed/series A equity investments, almost exclusively invested in companies that had prior been in GRA’s loan or grant portfolio</dd><dt id="question4">What is the structure of the GRA Venture Development program?</dt><dd>The GRA Venture Development program (GRAV) provides milestone-based funding through three phases.<p>
• GRA provides preliminary Phase I grants (up to $50K) at the earliest stages of commercialization — often before the official disclosure of the invention to the university. Phase I grants are broken up into two tranches IA and IB; the release of tranche IB is contingent on the completion of Phase IA milestones.</p>
<p>
• GRA also provides Phase II grants (up to $100k) to spur the formation of companies. These grants require a dollar-for-dollar match from a commercially relevant entity or granting agency and generally come after the completion of Phase I grant funding and milestone completion. Phase II grants are broken up into two tranches IIA and IIB; the release of tranche IIB is contingent on the completion of Phase IIA milestones.</p>
<p>
• GRA provides Phase III low-interest loans to qualified companies in Georgia, which are repaid to a pool of funds that supports new loans. Phase III loans generally come after the completion of Phase II grant funding and milestone completion. Phase III loans are broken up into two tranches IIIA and IIIB; the release of tranche IIIB is contingent on the completion of Phase IIIA milestones.</p>
<p>
• GRA Venture Fund, LLC provides <i>early-stage direct investment capital</i> to qualified companies (typically, companies that have successfully completed their Phase I and II milestones). The Fund includes 64 private investors, and every dollar invested by the state is matched at least 3:1 on every direct investment.</p> </dd><dt id="question5">How do I apply for GRA grant funding?</dt><dd>GRA partners with representatives at USG Institutions who pre-validate the commercial viability of academic innovations before submitting proposals to GRA. The current set of representatives are listed below. If your institution is not listed, please contact ashort@gra.org for guidance. </dd><dd>

</dd><dt id="question6">What happens after I submit my proposal to GRA?</dt><dd>After your university representative submits your proposal, it undergoes a review process that takes 30-60 days. Feedback will be provided to your University Representative at the end of the review process.</dd></dl>
<h2 id="category2">2. Eligibility for GRA Funding and Application</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="question7">What are GRA's funding eligibility criteria?</dt><dd>Eligible projects must exhibit a clear commercial potential focusing on reducing commercial risk of the product/service. They should be based on IP originating from a USG institution or IP that may likely be developed in the future. The proposal should entail funding for the mitigation of commercially relevant risk factors such as prototype development, technology feasibility studies, market research, IP assessment, etc. Lastly, projects should have the potential for high growth post proof of concept.</dd><dt id="question8">What are type of matching funding is required to be eligible for Phase II grant funding?</dt><dd> The match must meet or exceed the dollar amount requested for Phase II funding (e.g., if you are applying for $50K Phase IIA GRA grant funding, you must have an alternative source of at least $50K in funding). The match also needs to be related to developing the commercial potential of the product or service. SBIR and STTR grants are the most common sources of matching funds, because these grants are specifically geared towards commercialization activities. Traditional NIH, NSF, DoD or DoE awards to academic investigators are not eligible matches because they are not geared towards commercialization activities. </dd><dt id="question9">Can a past external grant count as matching funds for a later Phase II application? </dt><dd>Yes; as long as the past external grant meets the general criteria for Phase II matching funds and applies to the same technology/project, there’s no “expiration date” at which that earlier funding is no longer eligible for the Phase II match. </dd></dl>
<h2 id="category3">3. Use of GRA Funds</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="question10">What counts as permissible uses of GRA Funds?</dt><dd>Generally, funds can be used for activities that reduce commercial risk including prototype development, technology feasibility studies, market research, customer discovery, IP assessment, regulatory and reimbursement assessment. More details are available via the proposal documents and via conversation with your Institution rep. </dd><dt id="question11">Are there restrictions on the use of GRA funds?</dt><dd>Yes, there are strict constraints on the use of GRA funds to comply with Georgia law. Please confer with your Institution rep for more detail, but for example, during Phases I and II, compensation of any individual who holds equity, warrants, or options in a GRA-funded company is prohibited. Patent prosecution or legal expenses associated with incorporation or technology licensing are also prohibited. Additionally, Phase I funds cannot be used for equipment purchases that would be considered capital items by the university (exceeding $5000).</dd><dt id="question12">Who can get paid from the GRA funds during Phase I and II?</dt><dd>University personnel, including faculty, post-docs, graduate students, and other research staff, can receive salary and fringe benefits from the GRA funds.</dd><dt id="question13">Are any types of equipment purchases allowed within Phase I?</dt><dd>Yes, small equipment purchases are allowed. However, any equipment that would be considered an asset or a capital item by the university, typically any items costing $5,000 or more, are not permitted.</dd><dt id="question14"></dt><dd>GRA funds have to comply with University regulations and Georgia State Law. No company founders, equity holders, or employees can receive GRA funds. For Phase II projects, GRA requires a minimum funding match of 1:1 in order to validate the commercial opportunity. Matching funds can come from different sources such as angel investments, venture capital investments, strategic partner investments etc.</dd><dt id="question15">Can GRA grant funding go directly to the company?      </dt><dd>No, grant funding must go to the University first in phases I and II.</dd><dt id="question16">Can a GRA-funded company undertake manufacturing overseas?</dt><dd>Yes, as long as your company’s headquarters and R&amp;D activities are Georgia-based.</dd><dt id="question17">Can we use GRA funds for branding and marketing support?</dt><dd>No, GRA funds cannot be used for branding and marketing support.</dd></dl>
<h2 id="category4">4. Phase-Specific Information</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="question18">What is the purpose of each phase (IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB)?</dt><dd>Phase I is for proof of concept work, Phase II is for commercialization activities, and Phase III is a loan program geared to support the newly established company. Funds are granted in tranches (A and B) based on the completion of the milestones laid out for each phase. </dd><dt id="question19">What activities are usually carried out in Phase I and Phase II?</dt><dd>In Phase I, the funds are typically used to establish the commercial and technical feasibility through activities like technical assessments, IP investigations, and regulatory assessments. During Phase II, funds are typically used to validate the commercial opportunity through customer validation and technical feasibility validation.</dd><dt id="question20">Is company incorporation need for Phase I funds?</dt><dd>No, company incorporation is not a requirement to receive Phase I awards, but a company is usually formed prior to the receipt of Phase II awards.</dd><dt id="question21">Do the matching funds for GRA Phase 2 need to be money in the bank or can they include previously awarded commercialization grants?</dt><dd>Matching funds can include previously awarded commercialization grants.</dd><dt id="question22">What are type of matching funding is required to be eligible for Phase II grant funding?</dt><dd>The match must meet or exceed the dollar amount requested for Phase II funding (e.g., if you are applying for $50K Phase IIA GRA grant funding, you must have an alternative source of at least $50K in funding). The match also needs to be related to developing the commercial potential of the product or service. SBIR and STTR grants are the most common sources of matching funds, because these grants are specifically geared towards commercialization activities. Traditional NIH, NSF, DoD or DoE awards to academic investigators are not eligible matches because they are not geared towards commercialization activities. </dd></dl>
<h2 id="category5">5. Intellectual Property (IP) and Patent Concerns</h2>
<dl>
<dt id="question23">Can GRA funds be used for patent prosecution or legal expenses related to technology licensing?</dt><dd>No, the funds cannot be used for patent prosecution or legal expenses related to technology incorporation or technology licensing for Phases I and II.</dd><dt id="question24">If I create new intellectual property using GRA funds, who does it belong to?</dt><dd>Any new intellectual property created as a result of the project will be assigned to the partner institution.</dd><dt id="question25">Can GRA funds be used for patent prosecution or legal expenses related to technology licensing?</dt><dd>No, the funds cannot be used for patent prosecution or legal expenses related to technology incorporation or technology licensing for Phases I and II.</dd><dt id="question26">Is a particular IP status needed at different stages? </dt><dd>This will depend on the patent's relevance and the phase of the project. Please consult with the GRA team for exact requirements. Generally, an invention disclosure at the least is required for Phase I funding. </dd><dt id="question27">Do we need our own patent attorney?</dt><dd>Once your company forms, you will need your own attorney.</dd></dl>
<h2 id="category6">6. Loan qualification and terms</h2>
